      <h2>Here's a time line of Lionel Messi's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 17</span> - Messi announced himself to Spanish football as a 17-year-old, making his debut against Espanyol before going on to get his first goal, a delightful lob in a win over Albacete, having had a similar finish harshly disallowed. That season also brought his first piece of silverware, as Barca won La Liga.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 18</span> - On the international stage, Messi's career has been a case of 'what might have been' and the signs were there right from the start. His Argentina debut at the age of 18 lasted less than a minute, as he was sent off in a friendly against Hungary. However, he did get his first goal at the same age, scoring against Croatia. At club level, he got his hands on the Champions League for the first time, plus a second La Liga title and the Spanish Supercopa.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 19</span> - A second successive Supercopa arrived for Messi when he was 19, though his greatest achievement of the year was his first hat-trick, in El Clasico of all games. A clinical finish at the end of a flowing move was followed by an emphatic volley and fine solo effort in a 3-3 draw.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 20</span> - Although he was clearly already destined for greatness, Messi's career may have been significantly different had Pep Guardiola not been appointed Barca coach when the forward was 20. His arrival came after Frank Rijkaard could only guide Barca to third in LaLiga.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 21</span> - Messi found another level and truly established himself as Barca's key player at the age of 21. He scored 38 goals that year, helping the club to a remarkable treble, which included his second European title and a third La Liga crown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 22</span> - Champions League and Copa del Rey retention were beyond Barca the following year, though Messi still got to lift the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup for the first time. The Blaugrana also won La Liga and the Supercopa, while Messi took home his first Ballon d'Or and European Golden Shoe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 23</span> - Another glorious year followed, as Messi got his hands on a fifth La Liga title and won the Champions League for the third time. He scored 53 goals as a 23-year-old, a personal best at the time, and unsurprisingly clinched a second successive Ballon d'Or.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 24</span> - Although the two main trophies eluded Barca and Messi when he was 24, it proved to be his best year to date in terms of goals. He scored a remarkable 73 in all competitions, making him the obvious winner of a third consecutive Ballon d'Or and second European Golden Shoe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 25</span> - Incredibly, Messi reached the 300 goals mark for Barca when he was just 25. The same year he guided the team to the league title - his sixth - and won the Ballon d'Or for the fourth season in a row, making him the first to ever achieve the feat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 26</span> - Having passed the 300 mark at 25, netting 60 that year, Messi became Barca's all-time leading scorer across all matches - including friendlies - when he was 26, passing Paulino Alcantara's record of 369. The Spanish Supercopa was the only trophy he won that year, however, as Gerardo Martino was dismissed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 27</span> - Messi's Champions League drought ended when he was 27 and he was truly back to his best. He boosted his goal haul from 41 the previous year to 58, passing the 400 mark in the process, and inspired the team to another treble.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 28</span> - It was another hugely successful year for Messi at 28, with LaLiga, the Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup all added to the crowded Barca trophy cabinet. Messi also increased his personal collection, winning a fifth Ballon d'Or. He also overtook Gabriel Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time leading scorer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 29</span> - The goals landmarks continued to tumble at 29, with Messi surpassing 500 in a Barca shirt. For the year he scored an impressive 54, earning himself a fourth European Golden shoe.

          <span class="bold">Age 30</span> - Early in the 2017-18 season, Messi became the first player to reach 350 LaLiga goals and made his 600th appearance for the club across all competitions in November. After the turn of the year, he broke Gerd Muller's record for most league goals at one club in Europe's top five competitions, before helping Barca to a domestic double, while they also set a new record unbeaten streak in LaLiga - 43 matches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 31</span> - With Andres Iniesta gone, Barca made Messi their new captain in August 2018 and he lifted his first trophy as skipper the same month, winning the Supercopa. He was inspirational in the title win, sparing the team's blushes several times with late goals and winning a sixth Pichichi trophy, equalling Telmo Zarra's record. He also netted his 600th Barca goal but Champions League and Copa del Rey success eluded the Blaugrana.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Age 32</span> - Messi was shortlisted as one of the three finalists for both the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award and the 2019 Best FIFA Men's Player Award, with Messi winning the latter on 23 September,  Messi finished the season as both the top-scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy.

          <span class="bold">Age 33</span> - Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best FIFA Men's Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three candidates.Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4-0 in the 2021 Copa del Rey Final.
